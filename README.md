In this article, I will explain how to execute an end-to-end sentiment analysis project. For this project, I am using advanced methods instead of a simple setup. Specifically, I will be using a Docker-based Linux distribution for the analysis. I will also explain how to create your own Docker container using a Dockerfile and then use it for the sentiment analysis task. The project will utilize the following tools: OS, plugins
  1. Docker software
  2. Alpine linux docker image
  3. Python
  4. SSH
  5. Python Libraries (Panda, Numpy , Skitlern)

## Introduction/Definition 

### Sentiment Analysis 

Sentiment analysis is a process used to understand the emotions or opinions expressed in a piece of text. It involves analyzing text to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. This technique is commonly used to analyze customer reviews, social media posts, and other written feedback to gauge people's feelings or attitudes toward a product, service, or topic.

### Docker

Docker is a tool that makes it easy to create, share, and run applications in a lightweight, isolated environment. It packages everything the application needs to run, so it works the same on any computer.

### Docker Image

A Docker image is like a blueprint. It contains all the files, code, libraries, and settings needed to run an application. You can think of it as a snapshot of the application and its environment.

### Docker Container

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. Itâ€™s like a virtual box where your application runs, using the resources defined in the image. Containers are isolated, meaning they run independently from other applications on the system.

## Docker Setup

### Docker Pre-setup

In this example, I will use a Windows laptop, so I am using the Docker setup for Windows to build the Docker image. It's important to note that Docker images don't depend on whether you use Windows, Linux, or macOS. All you need is Docker pre-installed to create Docker images. You can download the Docker setup for free from the official Docker website. I will skip the installation process and move directly to creating the required Docker setup.


### Write DockerFile
